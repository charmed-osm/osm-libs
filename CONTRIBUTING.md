- All enhancements require review before being merged. Apart from code quality and test coverage,
  the review will also take into account the resulting user experience for Juju administrators

## Setup

A typical setup using [snaps](https://snapcraft.io/) can be found in the [Juju
docs](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/dev-setup).

## Developing

You can use the environments created by `tox` for development:

```shell
tox --notest -e unit
source .tox/unit/bin/activate
```

### Testing

```shell
tox -e fmt       # update your code according to linting rules
tox -e lint      # code style
tox -e static    # static analysis
tox -e unit      # unit tests
tox              # runs 'lint', 'static' and 'unit' environments
```
